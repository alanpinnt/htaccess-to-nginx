#htaccess-to-nginx

As of 2/14/2026 - I'm no longer updating this repo. Just keeping it here. For anyone else that needs it. 

This is really basic and not the greatest code to take htaccess rewriterules and convert them to rewrite or location rules for nginx. 

This is great for those with a lot of rewrite rules, saves a ton of time. But expect to edit the code and the results to your needs.
